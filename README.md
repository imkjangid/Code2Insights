# Welcome to the Code2Insight

![alt text](site-images/Code2Insights-wide.png)

This repository serves as a comprehensive analytics project, systematically documenting the end-to-end data lifecycle. It features a series of well-documented Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts for the entire process, including initial raw data cleaning, methodical data manipulation, and the creation of insightful visualizations. The project is organized to clearly demonstrate the transformation of unstructured information into actionable business intelligence.

This repository is designed on a modular architecture, with each component designed for reusability and easy maintenance. The core functionalities are separated into the following Python components:

> **Data Ingestion & Cleaning**: Scripts and notebooks handle the initial data processing, including outlier detection, missing value imputation, and data type correction.

> **Data Manipulation & Feature Engineering**: Dedicated modules are used for complex data restructuring, aggregation, and the creation of new features critical for downstream analysis.


> **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualization**: Interactive Jupyter notebooks drive the data exploration process, where we perform in-depth analysis and generate custom visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn. These visuals are instrumental in identifying key patterns like trends, and relationships hidden within the dataset.

This setup ensures a reproducible and transparent analytical process, moving from raw information to comprehensive, data-driven conclusions.

## Data analytics workflow

<blockquote>

**Define the objective (ask)**:
- Clearly articulate the business problem or question you are trying to solve.
- Establish Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics to measure success.
- Identify the target audience or stakeholders and their expectations for the analysis.
- Determine the scope of the project and potential constraints or assumptions.

**Gather and access data (prepare)**:
- Identify and secure access to all relevant data sources, both internal and external.
- Determine the type of data required (e.g., demographic, transactional, behavioral).
- Understand the data lineage (how data was collected, processed, and stored).
- Assess data availability and any potential limitations or biases in the sources.


**Clean and prepare data (process)**:
- Identify and address data quality issues: missing values, duplicates, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- Standardize data formats and types across different sources.
- Transform data as needed for analysis: normalize, scale, aggregate, and create new features (feature engineering).
- Document cleaning steps and assumptions for reproducibility.

**Explore and analyze**:
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualizations and summary statistics to understand patterns, trends, and relationships.
- Select and apply appropriate analytical techniques: descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, or prescriptive analytics, based on the objective.
- Develop and validate models (if applicable): choose algorithms, train models, tune parameters, and assess performance.
- Iterate on analysis and modeling as new insights emerge or the problem definition evolves.


**Interpret and communicate findings (share):**
- Interpret results in the context of the business problem and original objectives.
- Quantify the impact and value of insights for stakeholders.
- Present findings clearly and concisely using effective data visualization libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, etc.).
- Develop a data story that connects insights to business implications and recommended actions.

**Implement and monitor (act)**:
- Translate insights into actionable recommendations and integrate them into business processes.
- Deploy models (if applicable) for ongoing use in production environments.
- Monitor key metrics and track the impact of implemented changes over time.
- Establish feedback loops to continuously evaluate effectiveness and refine the analysis process.

## Mathematics for Data Analytics
Here are key mathematical areas for data analytics and some references for further learning:

### Probability and Statistics
This is the most critical area of mathematics for data analytics, as it is used to summarize, interpret, and make predictions from data.
<blockquote>

**Descriptive statistics**: Used to summarize and describe the main features of a dataset.

**Inferential statistics**: Involves using a sample of data to make predictions or draw conclusions about a larger population.

**Probability distributions**: Used to model random events, such as the normal, binomial, and Poisson distributions.

**Hypothesis testing**: Used to determine if a set of data provides enough evidence to support a particular conclusion.</blockquote>

### Linear Algebra
This field is fundamental for representing and manipulating data, which is often stored in matrices and vectors. 

<blockquote>

**Vectors and matrices**: How datasets are represented and manipulated.

**Matrix operations**: Including addition, multiplication, and transposition, which are used to perform complex calculations on datasets.

**Eigenvalues and eigenvectors**: Used in dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to find the most important features in a dataset.
